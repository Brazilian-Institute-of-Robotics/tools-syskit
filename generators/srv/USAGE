Generates a new data service. The argument is the name of the service, either in
CamelCase or in snake_case form. It can be prefixed with namespace(s)
in/this/form or In::This::Form. It is not necessary to add the bundle namespace
in front (it gets added automatically)

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen srv sensors/depth_srv

  will generate a RockAuv::Sensors::DepthSrv data service in
  models/blueprints/sensors/depth_srv.rb. No test file are generated as there is
  nothing to test in a data service
