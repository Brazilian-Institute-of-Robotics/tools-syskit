Generates a new communication bus model. The argument is the name of the bus
type, either in CamelCase or in snake_case form. It can be prefixed with
namespace(s) in/this/form or In::This::Form. It is not necessary to add the
bundle namespace in front (it gets added automatically)

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen bus schilling_dts

  will generate a RockAuv::Devices::Bus::ShillingDts data service in
  models/devices/bus/shilling_dts.rb. No test file are generated as there is
  nothing to test in a com bus model.

  The files up in the hierarchy (here models/devices/bus.rb) are updated to
  require the new file(s)
