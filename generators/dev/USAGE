Generates a new device model. The argument is the name of the model, either in
CamelCase or in snake_case form. It can be prefixed with namespace(s)
in/this/form or In::This::Form. It is not necessary to add the bundle namespace
in front (it gets added automatically)

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen dev sonars/tritech/gemini720i

  will generate a RockAuv::Devices::Sonars::Tritech::Gemini720i device type in
  models/devices/tritech/gemini720i.rb. No test file are generated as there is
  nothing to test in a data service

  The files up in the hierarchy (here models/devices/tritech.rb) are updated to
  require the new file(s)
