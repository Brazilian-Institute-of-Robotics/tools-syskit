Generates a new composition (a subclass of Syskit::Composition).
The argument is the name of the composition class, either in
CamelCase or in snake_case form. It can be prefixed with namespace(s)
in/this/form or In::This::Form. It is not necessary to add the bundle namespace
in front (it gets added automatically)

If a robot name is specified with the -r option, the files will be created in
this robot's specific folders

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen cmp sensing/localization

  will generate a RockAuv::Sensing::Localization data service in
  models/blueprints/sensing/localization.rb, and the associated
  test template in test/blueprints/sensing/test_localization.rb.
