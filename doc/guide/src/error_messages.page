== pkg-config --list-all returns an error

Debian and debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) sometime have broken pkg-config
dependencies between some packages. If you run pkg-config --list-all on a
console, this leads to an output whose last lines look like:

  Package libdrm was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libdrm.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  Package 'libdrm', required by 'dri', not found

The problem is that oroGen-generated components (most notably, the logger
component), might require pkg-config --list-all to find out what to load. The
orocos components will therefore fail if pkg-config --list-all fails.

To avoid this  situation, Orocos.initialize reports the following error:

  ArgumentError: pkg-config --list-all returns an error. Run it in a console and install packages that are reported.

So, just do that. You will have to find what package contains the package_name.pc
file (for instance by searching on packages.debian.org or
packages.ubuntu.com). In the example above, one would search the libdrm.pc file,
and find out that it is provided by the libdrm-dev package. You then have to
install it with:

  sudo apt-get install libdrm-dev
