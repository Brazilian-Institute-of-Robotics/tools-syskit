pkg-config --list-all returns an error
--------------------------------------

Debian and debian-based systems (like Ubuntu) sometime have broken pkg-config
dependencies between some packages. If you run pkg-config --list-all on a
console, this leads to an output whose last lines look like:

    cairo-ft                                       cairo-ft - FreeType font backend for cairo graphics library

    Package libdrm was not found in the pkg-config search path.
    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libdrm.pc'
    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
    Package 'libdrm', required by 'dri', not found

The problem is that oroGen-generated components (most notably, the logger
component), might require pkg-config --list-all to find out what to load. The
orocos components will therefore fail if pkg-config --list-all fails.

To avoid this  situation, Orocos.initialize reports the following error:

    ArgumentError: pkg-config --list-all returns an error. Run it in a console and install packages that are reported.

So, just do that. You will have to find what package contains the package_name.pc
file (for instance by searching on packages.debian.org or
packages.ubuntu.com). In the example above, one would search the libdrm.pc file,
and find out that it is provided by the libdrm-dev package. You then have to
install it with:

    sudo apt-get install libdrm-dev

failed to contact the name server (Orocos::CORBAError)
------------------------------------------------------
The CORBA layer needs a name service to find out what components are available,
and how to contact them. This message appears when this  name service cannot be
contacted. There can be the following reasons:

 * the Orocos::CORBA.name_service attribute, used to specify the hostname of the
   name service machine, is set to a wrong value.
 * there is a firewall blocking TCP port 2809
 * the name service is not running on the machine you think it is. You can check
   that with

   sudo netstat -tl

   If the service is running, there should be a line starting with 'tcp' and
   ending with 2809/omniNames.

**On Debian and Ubuntu**, the OmniORB nameserver startup script does **not**
report an error if the name service startup failed. If you have checked (as
above) that the name service is not running, you can start it by hand to see why
it is not starting with

sudo omniNames
{: .commandline}

Sometimes, the service's log file gets corrupted. In that case, the above
command will yield an error looking like:

<pre>
Error: parse error in log file '/var/lib/omniorb/omninames-mercury.log' at line 1.
</pre>

The best solution then is to simply delete all omninames log files with

sudo rm -f /var/lib/omniorb/*
{: .commandline}
