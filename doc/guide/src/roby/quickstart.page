Example system

TODO: asguard image

TODO: block diagram

We will focus on the control loop of a wheeled robot. This control loop is made
of a few different components:

 * a motor driver component that communicates with the motor hardware
 * a control component which does closed-loop control of the wheels, using the
   motor driver as an interface to the motors and the wheel sensors.
 * a command input, which gives the consign to the control component
