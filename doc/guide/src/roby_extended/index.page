Now that you have seen [the basics of the Roby plugin](../roby/index.html), we'll get into its more
complex (and more interesting) uses. All the more advanced features will be
described by using the example of a robot at DFKI, the Asguard robot.

 * its overall architecture will be presented. Then, we will discuss the
   __communication busses__ feature, that is used in the device list to handle
   things like CAN busses.
 * we will then present its ability to reuse abstract composition models through
   the use of specializations, i.e. to **create and select specialized composition
   models** tailored for a particular task context, without losing the abstraction
   information.
 * finally, the **online adaptation API** will also be presented
