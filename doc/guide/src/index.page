This library allows you to control Orocos/RTT components from Ruby, i.e. to set
them up, start/stop and monitor them. It assumes that you have a basic knowledge
of what the Orocos/RTT is, and about the Orocos/RTT component model. If you do
not, then you can find information in the documentation of [the oroGen component
generator](http://doudou.github.com/doudou/orogen) and the [Orocos/RTT
itself](http://orocos.org/rtt).

While the orocos.rb bindings do *not* require you to use the oroGen code
generator, some functionality will not be available if you don't. Moreover,
orocos.rb uses the CORBA interface to the modules, so you need your deployments
to use CORBA (in oroGen, use the <tt>--corba</tt> option during code
generation).

The next page is a step-by-step on the basics of how to start modules, set them
up, build the communication network and stop everything. Then, the rest of the
guide will present all the available functionality in more details.
